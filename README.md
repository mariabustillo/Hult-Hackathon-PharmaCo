# Hult-Hackathon-PharmaCo

The project has three objectives

Objective 1 - PubMed Database Analysis

Parsing the XML Files of PubMed and creating a R Data frame with the targeted feature set.
Applying Latent Dirichlet Allocation for Analyzing the Text Data
Identifying “Trending Topics” which help in the company in narrowing down on the new drug research sector.

Objective 2 - Diabetes Dataset – Excel file

The dataset contains 21 medications (Insulin, Metformin, Glimepiride, …) and we have data of customers using the medication. We have data related to Hospital Admission and Re Admissions. With the data available we can measure the efficacy of the drug and more importantly the pharmaceutical molecule efficacy.

Measuring drug efficacy at group level is also possible which can provide great insights. For e.g.) Sulfonylureas group encompasses chlorpropamide, glimepiride, glipizide, glyburide, tolbutamide, glipizide-metformin. We have identified a total 8 Drug groups, Biguanides, Meglitinides, Sulfonylureas, Thiazolidinediones, Alpha-glucosidase, gliptins. As a part of this hackathon, we aim to measure efficacy at the Drug Group Level.

Objective 3 - Target Customers

Identifying Market Size based on the race, age, gender, we can get great insights on our target customer information. When it comes to drug research, customer demographics is an important tool in measure drug efficiency parameters as well.
